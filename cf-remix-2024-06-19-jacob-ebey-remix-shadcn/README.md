## Development

Apply migrations:

```sh
npx wrangler d1 migrations apply DB --local
```

Run the Vite dev server:

```sh
npm run dev
```

## Deployment

In the Cloudflare Dashboard:

- Create a new Cloudflare Pages application
- Set the `Build command` to `npm run build`
- Set the `Build output directory` to `/build/client`
- Set the environment variable `SESSION_SECRET` to an super duper secret and strong value
- Deploy the app (it will be in a broken state, that's fine)
- Create or or link an existing D1 database to the app as `DB`

In your project:

- Update your wrangler.toml `database_id` to the ID of the linked D1 database you used above
- Apply database migrations: `npx wrangler d1 migrations apply DB`
- Commit and push to deploy your application
